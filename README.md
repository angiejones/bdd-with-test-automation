# Utilizing Good Gherkin for Test Automation

This code base shows how to utilize minimalist BDD-style Gherkin files for test automation. As a good practice, the implementation details are not specified in the Gherkin file, but instead are pushed down to the code level. This allows automation engineers to be free to implement the scenarios as they see fit.

This code demonstrates how to automate against UI, API, and even visual testing even though the Gherkin steps do not explicitly state this.

Video demonstration of this code base can be found as part of the [2019 Automation Guild Conference](https://guildconferences.com/).
